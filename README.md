## Available utilities

The following code excerpt presents some of the utilities this codebase makes available to work with the collection.

This codebase uses [Peewee as an ORM](https://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/) to manage a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database.

```python
import utils
from models import BookIO

# `BookIO` is a Peewee model for the "book_io" table.
# See Peewee's documentation for more info on how to work with models:
# https://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/

# Retrieving an individual book by barcode
book = book.get(barcode="ABCDEF")
print(book.jsonl_data) # The full JSONL data is not stored at database level, but retrieved on the fly.
print(book.csv_data) # ... same goes for data coming from books.csv

# Iterating over the collection
for book in Book.select().iterator():
    print(book)

# Quick access to the Peewee db connector itself
db = utils.get_db()
```

All [models](/models/) cross-reference `BookIO` via a `book` foreign key.
